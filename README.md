## ðŸš€ &nbsp; Usage


Get figure information with figure id
``` bash
from MFC import MFC
figure = MFC.searchFigure("1711391")

# Get information of the figure
name = figure.name
image = figure.image
figure_id = figure.figure_id
url = figure.url
category = figure.category
origin = figure.origin
character = figure.character
company = figure.company
artist = figure.artist
version = figure.version
release = figure.release
material = figure.material
dimensions = figure.dimensions

```

Get a list of figures with character name
``` bash
from MFC import MFC
result = MFC.search("hatsune miku")

# Alternatively, show draft figures that have no yet been released
# result = MFC.search("hatsune miku", show_draft=True)

# Get information of the first figure in the results
name = result[0].name
figure_id = result[0].figure_id
url = result[0].url
thumbnail = result[0].thumbnail
```

Sorting and ordering figure results
``` bash
# Default order is desc.
# Default sort is by release date 

# Find hatsune miku figures, sorted by release date, from newest to oldest, no drafts
result = MFC.search("hatsune miku")

# Does the same thing, since all options are defaulted
result = MFC.search("hatsune miku", sort="date", order="desc", show_draft=False)

# Find hatsune miku figures, sorted by release date, from oldest to newest, showing drafts
result = MFC.search("hatsune miku", sort="date", order="asc", show_draft=True)

# Find hatsune miku figures, sorted by popularity
result = MFC.search("hatsune miku", sort="popularity")

# Find hatsune miku figures, sorted by price
result = MFC.search("hatsune miku", sort="price")
